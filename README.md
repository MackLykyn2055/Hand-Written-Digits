my first training neural network on handwritten digits

Firstly when drawing some random single digits image
open that image to the main file
then each pixels is represent in the form of binary digits 0 and 1
then put those binary digits in a list 
when 1 is not in that row then that row should not add to a list
as well as column when 1 is not there then that column will be remove
after that that list of binary digits is sent to a hidden layer in this case it's layer 1 by its rows

In there it will divide the images in 4, i.e the top, the middle up , the middle down and the bottom
and i've created a dictionary that has a key or decimal 0-9 with its value 0 as origin
then after perform those operation some dictionary will get added so many times
then that dictionary is return to the main code

In main code it will display which of the key in that dictionary has more value
and the output will be printed

My code might not be 100% work but at least 70%

You can try additionally create another hiddenlayer with respect to column

Thank you
